DB with all tables should be created, all functions should be added.

connection settings must be set in 'config' file and placed in the same directory as 'actions.py'

Run: actions.py
without any parameters - it will add to DB 10 customers with addresses and orders.


1) Review db structure:
- different sequences must be used for primary keys in each table:
    customer =  pk_cust_seq
    address  =  pk_addr_seq
    orders   =  pk_ordr_seq

2) New dictionary table must be added for Order's status:
  orders.key_status - must be changed to foreign key.
  
  new table "order_status":
    id_status - BIGINT, status code, primary key
    status    - TEXT,   status description.
    
    sequence 'pk_stat_seq' should be used for id_status.
 
3) New table must be added to represent relationships between Customer and Address.

  new table "cust_addr_link":
    id_link      - BIGINT, link code.
    key_customer - BININT, foreign key (customer id).
    key_address  - BIGINT, foreign key (address id).
    
    sequence 'pk_link_seq' should be used for id_link.    
    the pair (key_customer, key_address) must be unique.
    
  so, "address" table must be changed:
    - field "key_customer" must be removed.
    - field "key_link" must be added as foreign key (linked to cust_addr_link.id_link).
   
  Table "orders" must be changed too:
    - fields "key_customer" and "key_address" must be removed.
    - field "key_link" must be added as foreign key (linked to cust_addr_link.id_link).
